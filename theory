# 📐 Theory – Electric Field from a Uniformly Charged Ring

This document explains the physics and math behind the electric field simulations presented in this repository.

---

## 🧲 Physical Setup

Consider this **uniformly charged circular ring**:

- Lies in the **x–y plane** at \( z = 0 \)
- Centered at the origin
- Radius: \( a \)
- Constant **line charge density**: \( \rho_l \) (in C/m)

---

## ⚡ Electric Field Expression

The electric field \( \vec{E} \) due to a **continuous line charge** is given by:

\[
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \int_L \frac{\rho_l \hat{R}}{R^2} \, dl
\]

Where:

- \( \vec{R} \): vector from the charge element to the observation point
- \( \hat{R} = \frac{\vec{R}}{|\vec{R}|} \)
- \( dl \): differential element along the ring
- \( \varepsilon_0 \): vacuum permittivity (\( \approx 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \))

---

## 🔢 Numerical Approximation

To simulate this in Python, we **discretize the ring** into \( N \) small segments:

\[
\vec{E} \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\rho_l \, \Delta l_i \, \vec{R}_i}{|\vec{R}_i|^3}
\]

- \( \vec{R}_i \): displacement from segment \( i \) to the field point
- \( \Delta l_i \): length of segment \( i \), typically \( \Delta l = \frac{2\pi a}{N} \)

---

## 🧮 Implementation Notes

- **Python scripts** use `numpy` arrays to store segment positions and compute field vectors.
- Vectorized computation accelerates grid-based sampling of the field.
- The user specifies the number of segments and the grid resolution.

---

## 📊 Interpretation of the Output

- **Mayavi version**: Displays continuous electric field lines flowing through space.
- **Matplotlib version**: Uses `quiver` arrows to indicate vector direction and magnitude.

These visualizations help explore:
- Field strength distribution
- Symmetry and behavior along the z-axis
- How local segment contributions accumulate

---

## 📚 Example Parameters

- \( a = 0.05 \, \text{m} \)
- \( \rho_l = 10 \, \text{C/m} \)
- \( N = 100 \) (segments)
- Grid samples: \( 15 \times 15 \times 15 \)

---

## 🔁 Extensions & Next Steps

- Add multiple rings or point charges
- Simulate electric potential \( V \) instead of \( \vec{E} \)
- Visualize using stream plots or animation
