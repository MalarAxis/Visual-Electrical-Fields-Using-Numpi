# Visual-Electrical-Fields-Using-Numpi
This project will contist of building upon the vector program I created

This repository has two different scripts, one that expresses the Electric Field in a Vector field while the other has a visual of the curvature of the field.

## üì∑ Preview of the curvature of the Electric Field

## üöÄ Features
- Discretizes a charged ring
- Calculates 3D electric field vectors
- Visualizes field lines with Mayavi

## üõ† Requirements
- Python 3.10+ Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Mayavi
- NumPy
- PyQt5
- Pyface
- (Optional but preferable) Anaconda Link: https://www.anaconda.com/download

## üì¶ Installation

When using Anaconda, insert the prompts below. Have not found a constist way to use pip on windows without it causing a massive headache.

```bash
conda create -n electricfield-env python=3.10
conda activate electricfield-env
conda install -c conda-forge mayavi pyface pyqt numpy

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once you've installed the required environment (see above), follow these steps:

1. **Download the script** (`electric_field.py`) and place it somewhere easy to find ‚Äî for example:
