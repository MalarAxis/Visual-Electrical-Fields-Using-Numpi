# Visual-Electrical-Fields-Using-Numpi
This project will contist of building upon the vector program I created

This repository has two different scripts, one that expresses the Electric Field in a Vector field while the other has a visual of the curvature of the field.

## 📷 Preview of the curvature of the Electric Field
